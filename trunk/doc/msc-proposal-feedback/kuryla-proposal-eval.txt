Siarhei Kuryla is working on an SNMP implementation for the embedded
Contiki operating system, using UDP/IPv6/6LoWPAN/IEEE 802.15.4 as the
underlying networking stack. The first chapter summarizes key
characteristics of the IEEE 802.15.4 standards. The chapters 2-5
provide a very nice overview of the state-of-the-art of IETF work done
in the the 6lowpan and roll working groups. The summary of SNMP in
chapter 5 is crisp as well. The writing style in general is very clear
and concise, something I really appreciate.

The weaker part of the proposal is the lack of an in depth discussion
how SNMP can be used in constrained environments. While the references
contain some related recently published papers, there is not much of a
review of the various trade-offs that can impact performance and
usability. In fact, a chapter following chapter 6 could be added
discussing more details how SNMP can be fit into 6lowpan environments,
a perfect place to discuss research work published in this space.  To
be fair, I note that the selection of the topic happened relatively
late and this is not Siarhei's fault. As such, I only comment on the
absence of a more detailed discussion how SNMP can be best applied in
6lowpans as means of documenting this; I will not count this for the
grading of the proposal.

Overall, I am satisfied with the proposal and I grade it with a 1.3.
